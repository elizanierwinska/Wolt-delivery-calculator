# Delivery Fee Calculator

Delivery fee calculator is a tool for calculating delivery fee.
It checks every form submit and calculate the delivery price.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
and is created for my application to Wolt's Software Engineer Intern (2024).

## Run the App

In the project directory, you can run:

```sh
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm start
```

This will run the application in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Run the Tests

Run the following command to check the unit and integration tests included for this application:

```sh
npm test
```

## Additional Notes

As I only found out about this internship opportunity on Monday, Jan. 29th 2024, this application
was made under time pressure and is imperfect.
I made sure to include the essential application logic that fits the requirement of the tasks.
Additionally, I would highly appreciate an opportunity to discuss with you about the project and
your critique/review of the code so as to further improve my knowledge on writing professional code.

Generally speaking, I would pay attention to the following points if I were to deveop frontend
application at Wolt.

### Readability and Documentation

I strive to ensure that the object naming is readable for my teammates and the code logic
is modularized and clean for ease of maintenance and refactoring.
The code documentation in the current application strives to comply to the JSDoc convention.

### UI Design & CSS Maintainability

I will collaborate with Wolt's UI/UX designers to work on the web interface to ensure it is
user friendly. Due to time limit, I attempted to make a simple but appealing page and switched
to focus on the TypeScript/React code to ensure that the core logic works as expected.

I strive to maintain CSS in a scalable manner and would choose SCSS or a framework, e.g
Tailwind CSS/Bootstrap to make the CSS more scalable and maintainable.
For the size and scope of this project, I chose to write vanilla CSS instead.

### Code Coverage

I have added unit tests as well as component-level end-to-end tests for the functions and logic.
In real life, I would also strive to write additional integration tests from a backend stub server
to frontend if applicable or whenever necessary.

### Clean Git Commit History

I strive to maintain a clean Git practice, e.g. squash the merge/pull request or rebase the branch before a merge.
In this project, I left the Git commits as is in case the reviewer is interested in the progression
of my coding process.

Working with Git, release, CI/CD, etc. in a professional setting is an area that I still need more exposure
to get better at and I am eager to become an intern to further develop this area.

Finally, thank you for reviewing this application. I look forward to discussing with you more in depth
about this project.
